# Source to Binary (RISC-V C Program)

This task demonstrates the step-by-step compilation process of a C program into a RISC-V binary using a `Makefile`. 
 
The process is broken down into four stages: **Preprocessing, Compiling, Assembling, and Linking**.

---

## Compilation Stages

### 1. Preprocessing
In this stage, the headers and macros in the C code are expanded and stored in a file with the `.i` extension.  
```bash
make preprocessor
